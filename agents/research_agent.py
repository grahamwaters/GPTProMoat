     Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions for the worker AI agent to develop the full code for the research agent based on the encryption algorithms found on GitHub:

        Research and select the encryption algorithms from GitHub that best fit the project's requirements.
        Download and install any necessary dependencies or libraries required for the chosen encryption algorithms.
        Write the code for each encryption algorithm, ensuring that it is properly documented and follows best coding practices.
        Test each encryption algorithm thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and produces the desired results.
        Integrate the encryption algorithms into the research agent codebase, making sure that they are properly imported and utilized.
        Test the research agent thoroughly to ensure that it properly encrypts and decrypts data using the chosen encryption algorithms.
        Optimize the code for performance and efficiency, making any necessary adjustments to improve speed and reduce resource usage.
        Document the code thoroughly, including comments and instructions for future maintenance and updates.
        Submit the completed code for review and feedback from the project manager or other stakeholders.
        Make any necessary revisions or adjustments based on feedback, and finalize the code for deployment.
