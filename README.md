# GPTProMoat
A privacy focused LLM data obfuscation tool that implements end-to-end encryption and prevents retraining on company data by GPT-4

Step 1: Research Agent
1.1. Research different encryption algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses.
1.2. Evaluate the suitability of each algorithm for the given task.
1.3. Identify potential vulnerabilities in each algorithm.
1.4. Document the research findings and present them to the Manager Agent.

Step 2: Encryption Agent
2.1. Based on the research findings from the Research Agent, select the most suitable encryption algorithm.
2.2. Develop the code for the encryption algorithm.
2.3. Test the encryption algorithm to ensure it is functioning correctly.
2.4. Document the encryption algorithm and present it to the Manager Agent.

Step 3: Decryption Agent
3.1. Develop the code for the decryption algorithm that corresponds to the encryption algorithm selected by the Encryption Agent.
3.2. Test the decryption algorithm to ensure it is functioning correctly.
3.3. Document the decryption algorithm and present it to the Manager Agent.

Step 4: Manager Agent
4.1. Evaluate the encryption and decryption algorithms developed by the Encryption and Decryption Agents.
4.2. Determine if any changes or improvements need to be made to the algorithms.
4.3. Coordinate with the Research Agent to identify any potential vulnerabilities in the algorithms and implement any necessary security measures.
4.4. Document the final encryption and decryption algorithms and present them to the client or stakeholders.

Please note that this is a high-level overview of the steps. The actual implementation will depend on the specific requirements of the task and the findings of the Research Agent.
